In this project, we are going to have a tournament style egg hunt competition. Each team designs and builds a
reactive robot that “hunts” for Easter eggs by autonomously locating and pushing the plastic eggs into their
own nest. The egg hunt takes place in an enclosed arena with “nests” at either end. The enclosure and the
nests will be surrounded by wooden fence. The color of the nests will be easily distinguishable from the color
of the rest of the arena. The enclosure will contain around 30 plastic eggs randomly scattered throughout.
The objective of the game is for each team to gather into its nest as many eggs as possible within 2 minutes.
The winner of a round is the team with more eggs. At the start of each round, each robot is placed next to its
home nest. The home nest will be assigned at the beginning of each round. Your robot should be able to
determine which side is its nest. Size limit on the overall structure of the robot (which includes any
protruding parts) is 10” x 12”.
Project Schedule:
First Stage (100 pts) Design and build your robot
Program and test the Wander() behavior and the PushEggIntoNest()
behavior
In-class Demo – Thursday March 16th
Demo results count 20 points.
Revise robot design as needed
Program and test the MoveTowardsEgg(), and the StopAtEgg() behaviors
the PushEggTowardsNest(), and the DetectWall behavior
In-class Demo – Thursday March 23rd
Demo results count 40 points.
Report 1 due: midnight, Thursday March 23rd, Report counts 20 pts.
Please type your report. Your report should include:
• Description of steps 1-6 of “the steps in designing a reactive behavior
system” as discussed in class. It should include the “behavior table”,
2
where each independent behavior of your robot is designed in the form
of “releaser, perceptual schema, percept, motor schema”.
• Testing results of individual behaviors
• Printout of the robotC program developed for the behaviors.
Robot construction counts 20 pts:
Robot design according to the project requirements and the affordance
found in the robot environment; good usage of sensors, motors and
mechanical design for the task.
Second Stage (100 pts) Assemble the behaviors. Modify individual behaviors as necessary.
Combine the individual behaviors for the task.
Second Demo (50 pts): Thursday, April 6th: In class demo will be done in
round robin tournament style. Teams involved in each match will be
determined at the beginning of the tournament by random draw.
Report 2 due: midnight, April 6th. Report counts 20 points. This report
should include:
• Description of test results for putting behaviors together;
• Describe any re-design/re-implementation/testing involved in the
process, and
• the complete robotC program for your robot.
Robot construction counts 15 pts.
Robot design according to the project requirements and the affordance
found in the environment; good usage of sensors, motors and mechanical
design for the task.
Program development counts 15 pts:
Software supports the designed behaviors
